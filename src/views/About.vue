    <p>
      Raised in the early days of the internet age, Christopher was
practically born with a motherboard in one hand, and a hard
drive in the other.<br />
The son of a software developer, he built his first computer
at the age of eight, and quickly moved to running his own
website as a forum moderator.<br />
After graduating high school, he pursued a career in web
development for a time. But less code-based forms of work
kept finding a way in, through his hobbies with raspberry pi
projects, helping family members with the usual my-laptop-
is-running-slow problems, tinkering with Linux, virtual boxes,
servers, and more. In 2017 he was hired for his first job in
the IT field, where his interest in the career grew to the
business that it is today.<br /><br />
In his spare time he likes complaining about the state of
modern MMOs and long romantic walks down Best Buy isles
with his wife.
